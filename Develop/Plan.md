## PLAN

- Create a work out request on page load
- When a work out is created, it's an empty object
- The date is set to right now
- When we hit the complete button or the add button, we update the workout
- The workout has an array of multiple exercise in it
- Probably going to use references to the exercises and populate the exercises property array
